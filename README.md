Example Plotting Script with Matplotlib
=======================================

## Installation

You'll need some programs, but if you're on a mac they should be easy to install:

 - First install [python 3][py3k]
 - Run `pip3 install matplotlib`

It should then install some stuff. Pip should also install numpy.

## How to use

Just run `./plots.py <files list> <num to average>`
